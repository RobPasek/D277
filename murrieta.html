      <h3>History of Murrieta, CA:</h3>
      <p>
        Murrieta’s roots go back to the early 19th century, when Esequial Murrieta, a wealthy Spanish-born rancher, 
        purchased 52,000 acres of land in Southern California in 1873 to raise sheep. Although he never lived in the area, 
        his brother Juan Murrieta oversaw operations and helped establish the land as a working ranch. The Murrieta family 
        eventually sold much of the land, which led to a small settlement forming in the late 1800s as the Southern California 
        Railroad built a rail line through the area
      </p>
      <p>
        In the early 20th century, Murrieta became a destination for travelers from the Los Angeles area, thanks to its natural 
        hot springs. The Murrieta Hot Springs Resort attracted visitors who sought the therapeutic benefits of the springs, boosting 
        tourism and slowly growing the local economy. However, after the railroad line was abandoned, Murrieta remained a small and rural 
        community with little development until the 1980s
      </p>
      <p>
        Murrieta underwent rapid suburban growth starting in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, as residents from San Diego and Los Angeles 
        moved inland in search of affordable housing. The city officially incorporated in 1991, and its population skyrocketed in subsequent 
        decades. Today, Murrieta is a thriving suburban community known for its family-friendly atmosphere and proximity to both major 
        Southern California cities and the wine country of Temecula​
