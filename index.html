        Sacramento, founded in 1839, has a rich history rooted in both early Californian exploration and the Gold Rush. 
        Swiss immigrant John Sutter established Sutter’s Fort near the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers, 
        with the aim of developing agriculture in the area. In 1848, gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, igniting the California Gold Rush. 
        The rush transformed Sacramento into a thriving hub as prospectors and entrepreneurs flooded the city. Its strategic location along 
        the river made it a key supply point for miners
      </p>
      <p>
        Incorporated as a city in 1850, Sacramento quickly became the state capital due to its prominence as a trade center and its 
        location in the fertile Central Valley. The city’s early years, however, were marked by challenges, including devastating floods and fires. 
        In response, city leaders undertook one of the earliest large-scale engineering projects in the United States, raising the downtown area by 
        several feet to protect it from future flooding. This infrastructural advancement helped cement Sacramento’s place as a critical political 
        and commercial center in California
      </p>
      <p>
        During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Sacramento continued to grow, boosted by the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. 
        The city played a pivotal role as the western terminus of the railroad, linking the Pacific Coast with the rest of the nation. Agriculture, transportation, 
        and government services shaped the local economy in the 20th century, and Sacramento’s growth continues today as the city evolves into a diverse and dynamic 
        urban area, while remaining the political heart of California
